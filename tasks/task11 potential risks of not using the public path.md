<h2>What is the Public Folder?<h2>
<p>The public directory in your Laravel project plays a crucial role in your application's structure. It serves as the entry point for the application and is the most secure folder to serve your production website from.</p>
<h2>The Potential Risks<h2>
<h3>Exposing sensitive information</h3>
<p>Laravelâ€™s structure has directories like config, database and .env outside the public directory for good reason.
<br>
These directories house confidential configurations, database migrations, seeds and environment variables that if accessible by a bad actor give them far more information than they could ever ask for.</p>
<h3>unhandled errors being displayed to users</h3>
<p>By limiting exposure to and serving content from the public directory, you ensure that users only see errors that have been purposely handled for the production environment.</p>
